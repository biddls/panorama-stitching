NOTE:
The only external assistance was from talking to course-mates (did not change the code I wrote)
I used GPT fill in all the functions initially before going back and writing my own implementation will not where its output has not been changed heavily
I Googled how to use specific function like np.repeat/argwhere but never did I use anyone that I found online, I didn't even find any code which would be helpful
